## Variables in Programming  
   
In programming, a variable is a named storage location in memory that holds a particular type of data. Variables are stored either in the memory stack or heap, and different variable types differ mainly in the size of memory they occupy.  
   
### Example in C++  
   
```cpp  
#include <iostream>  
   
int main() {  
    // int allows you to store values between approximately -2B to 2B  
    int variable = 8;  
    std::cout << variable << std::endl;  
  
    variable = 20;  
    std::cout << variable << std::endl;  
  
    std::cin.get();  
}  
```  
   
### Data Types and Their Sizes  
   
- **Int ("%d")**: 32-bit integer  
- **Long ("%ld")**: 64-bit integer  
- **Char ("%c")**: Character type  
- **Float ("%f")**: 32-bit real value  
- **Double ("%lf")**: 64-bit real value  
   
#### Data Type Sizes  
- **char**: 1 byte (8 bits)  
- **short**: 2 bytes (16 bits)  
- **int**: 4 bytes (32 bits)  
- **long**: 4 bytes (32 bits)  
- **long long**: 8 bytes (64 bits)  
   
These types can also be combined with `unsigned` to store only non-negative values.  
   
#### Example of Floating Point Types  
   
```cpp  
float var1 = 5.5f;  
double var2 = 5.2;  
```  
   
### Boolean Type  
   
- **bool**: Can be `true` (1) or `false` (0). Although a boolean could be represented with a single bit, it takes up one byte due to memory addressability constraints.  
   
```cpp  
sizeof(bool);  // Shows the size of the boolean type, which is 1 byte  
```  
   
### Pointers and References  
   
In addition to basic data types, C++ supports pointers and references, which are used to store memory addresses and provide indirect access to other variables.
