## A Deep Dive into C++ Compilation and Linking
### Preprocessing: The Foundation

* **Directives, Not Code:** Preprocessing directives like `#include` are not C++ code. They instruct the preprocessor, a tool that modifies the source code *before* compilation.
* **Header Inclusion:** `#include <iostream>` tells the preprocessor to find the `iostream` header file and insert its contents into your source code at that specific location. This brings in declarations for standard input/output objects like `cin` and `cout`.
* **Macro Definitions:** Other directives like `#define` create macros, which are essentially text replacements.

### Compilation: Turning Source Code into Machine Code

* **Translation Units:** Each `.cpp` file is a translation unit. The compiler processes each unit independently, translating the C++ code into assembly language and then into machine code (object code).
* **Object Files:** The result of compiling a translation unit is an object file (often with a `.obj` or `.o` extension). This file contains the machine code for that specific source file.
* **Declarations vs. Definitions:**
    * **Declaration:** Tells the compiler that a symbol (like a function or variable) exists, but doesn't provide its implementation.
    * **Definition:** Provides the actual implementation of the symbol.
    * **Example:** In a header file, you might declare a function `void myFunction();`. In a `.cpp` file, you'd define it with its actual code.

### Linking: Stitching Together the Pieces

* **Combining Object Files:** The linker takes multiple object files (possibly from different `.cpp` files) and combines them into a single executable file (usually with a `.exe` extension).
* **Resolving Symbols:** The linker resolves external references. If a function is *declared* in one file and *defined* in another, the linker ensures that the calls to that function in the first file are correctly linked to its implementation in the second file.
* **Libraries:** The linker can also link with libraries, which are pre-compiled collections of object code for commonly used functions (like those in the C++ standard library).

### Why Separate Files?

* **Modularity:** Breaking code into multiple files improves code organization and maintainability.
* **Reusability:** Header files allow you to easily reuse code in multiple projects.
* **Easier Compilation:** Smaller files compile faster.

### Key Points

* The compilation process involves preprocessing, compilation, and linking.
* Each `.cpp` file is compiled into an object file.
* The linker combines object files and resolves external references.
* Declarations and definitions are crucial for successful compilation and linking.
* Separating code into multiple files enhances code organization and reusability.


``` cpp
// Log.cpp
#include <iostream>

// Defination
void Log(const char* message)
{
    std::cout << message << std::endl;
}
```
``` cpp
// Main.cpp
#include <iostream>

// Declaration - we can also ignore the name of variable: Example: void Log(const char*);
void Log(const char* message);

int main() {
    Log("Hello World!!");
    std::cin.get();
}
